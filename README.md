# Quiz
creating a quiz with multiple questions and a timer

## Description
* In this assigment the object was to create a quiz that would progress as the user would select one of the question options.
* One of the requirements was to also have a timer and a high score page that would save localy.
* Also, whenever the user would select the wrong answer the timer was to decrease by a certain ammount.

## Functionality
* I created separa divs in the html file so that i could access them while working on the js file.
* I created an object containing questions options and answers in the js file.
* Made an event listener that went on the start button of the main front page that would set the quiz in motion.
* Created multiple functions which one would set and display the questions and choices and another which would move on to the next question when ever an option button was clicked.
* I also made a timer function which would just decrease in time one second at a time and starting at 75 seconds.
* When either the time was up or the questions where over it was meant for the quiz to end and for it to show the results.


## Problems
* At first I tried creating multiple functions which would be linking one question to the next.However, when i tried running it, the quiz would skip from the first question all the way to the last one and it would not display all the questions.

* A problem attached to the time was that when ever a wrong choice was selected either the timer would not decrese or it would start decreasing by multiple seconds instead of only by one.

* Trying to recreate the quiz from a given gif, i could not stop it and analize exactly what i was supposed to be doing.

* Setting and saving the high scores localy it is a hard thing to do.



## resources
* I recieved a lot of help from the TA Paul and he was a lot of help setting up the questions in this assignment.
* I looked to google when trying to set the time and also activity 4-8 was extremely helpful since that is basically when whole function that i used in this assignment.
* Having notes of the important syntex and functions helped when trying to decide how to continue and when i could not remmember how to write a function out.

## Final notes
* I hope to have been able to add in the high scores page on time
* The timer having decreased when a wrong option was selected i still needed to work on it
* Maybe creating more difficult questions as they go on would be a good idea
* In the furture i hope to be able to incorporate more stuff into building a javascript quiz.
